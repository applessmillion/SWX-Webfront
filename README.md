Rewrite the SmallWorlds.app homepage to address a few issues:
* It is not modern-browser friendly. The homepage relies on Adobe Flash and certain NodeJS elements to run.
* Optimize for larger screen resolutions & allow for responsive design. Currently the homepage min-maxes out at one size.
* Improve design & ideally add mobile-friendly view. While the main client is 100% required to enter the world and play, the homepage should not be tied to this restriction.
